# airflow-install

Install Airflow on InterTwin demo K8s cluster.

Based on this [blog post](https://medium.com/@dulshanr12/airflow-log-integration-with-fluent-bit-elk-stack-kubernetes-f2afa3a6ff00).

Airflow logs -> fluent bit -> Logstash -> ElasticSearch -> Kibana/Airflow
- Fluent Bit agents are deployed in every node (DaemonSet).
- Fluent Bit agents are able to access all pods logs from the ephemeral storage of the Nodes
- Airflow components output the logs in JSON format to standard out including airflow worker logs
- Fluent Bit agents collect these logs and send to Logstash
- Logstash receives the logs and forward it to Elasticsearch cluster with an index after power transformations if necessary.
- Kibana dashboard can then be used to search and analyze the logs.
- Airflow will try to fetch DAG log data from Elasticsearch(ES) when user tries to view the DAGSâ€™s task logs on the airflow web-UI.
